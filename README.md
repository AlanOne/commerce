# Craft Commerce 2

Craft Commerce is an amazingly powerful and flexible e-commerce platform for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com).

Learn more at [craftcommerce.com](https://craftcommerce.com).

The (WIP) documentation can be found here in the [commerce-docs](https://github.com/craftcms/commerce-docs) repo.

Craft Commerce 2 is currently in Alpha status and isn't available on Packagist or the Plugin Store quite yet -- we'll do that when we launch the Beta on 4/4.

You can email support@craftcommerce.com for installation instructions.
